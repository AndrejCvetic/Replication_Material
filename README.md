## Overview

This replication package contains data and code to replicate the analysis from **Discrimination that Matters: Replication with Extensions of "Perceived Discrimination and Political Behaviour" (2020)**. Two data sources, Fisher et al. 2012 & Diehl et al. 2016, were analyzed using `R` and `Stata`. The package includes three pre-processing `.do` files and 2 analysis `.r` scripts that generate 5 figures and 7 tables in the paper, as well as 22 figures and 58 tables in the appendix. The entire process is expected to run for about 25 minutes in total.
